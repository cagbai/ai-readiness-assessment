# AI Readiness Assessment Framework (Revised)

## Key Areas of AI Readiness

To provide a more concise yet comprehensive assessment, the following key areas will be used, with a focus on aspects relevant to the discovery phase of AI projects for a software development services company:

1.  **AI Strategy & Business Alignment:** How well is AI integrated into the overall business strategy, and how clearly defined are the business problems AI is intended to solve?
2.  **Data Foundation & Governance:** What is the quality, accessibility, and governance of data, and how prepared is it for AI model training and deployment?
3.  **Technology Infrastructure & Tools:** Does the organization have the necessary technological infrastructure and preferred tools to support AI development and deployment?
4.  **Talent, Skills & Culture:** Is there sufficient AI-savvy talent, and is the organizational culture conducive to adopting and collaborating on AI initiatives?
5.  **Risk Management & Ethical AI:** Are there processes in place to identify and mitigate risks, and to ensure ethical considerations are addressed in AI development?

## Assessment Questions and Scoring

For each question, respondents will rate their organization on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no readiness and 10 indicates full readiness. Each question will also include a contextual explanation for its importance.

### 1. AI Strategy & Business Alignment
*   **Question 1.1:** To what extent is your organization's AI strategy clearly defined and directly linked to specific, measurable business objectives?
    *   **Importance:** A clear AI strategy ensures that AI initiatives are not isolated experiments but are instead purposeful investments designed to deliver tangible business value. This alignment is crucial for successful project definition during the discovery phase.
*   **Question 1.2:** How well does your leadership understand the potential of AI and actively champion its adoption across the organization?
    *   **Importance:** Strong leadership buy-in and understanding are critical for securing resources, overcoming organizational inertia, and fostering a culture that embraces AI. This support is vital for smooth project execution from discovery to deployment.

### 2. Data Foundation & Governance
*   **Question 2.1:** How accessible, clean, and well-structured is the data required for potential AI projects within your organization?
    *   **Importance:** High-quality, accessible data is the lifeblood of effective AI models. Poor data quality or accessibility can significantly delay or derail AI projects, making data readiness a key factor in the discovery phase.
*   **Question 2.2:** Are there established processes for data governance, including data collection, storage, security, and privacy compliance?
    *   **Importance:** Robust data governance ensures that data used for AI is managed responsibly, securely, and in compliance with regulations. This minimizes legal and ethical risks and builds trust in AI systems.

### 3. Technology Infrastructure & Tools
*   **Question 3.1:** Does your organization have the necessary computing power (e.g., cloud, on-premise GPUs) and development environments to support AI model training and deployment?
    *   **Importance:** Adequate technological infrastructure is fundamental for developing and deploying AI solutions efficiently. Understanding existing capabilities helps in scoping projects and identifying infrastructure gaps early.
*   **Question 3.2:** How familiar are your technical teams with modern AI/ML tools, frameworks, and platforms (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, cloud AI services)?
    *   **Importance:** Proficiency with relevant tools and platforms accelerates development and ensures that solutions can be built and integrated effectively. This informs the choice of technology stack during the discovery phase.

### 4. Talent, Skills & Culture
*   **Question 4.1:** Does your organization possess or have access to the necessary AI/ML talent (e.g., data scientists, ML engineers, AI product managers) to drive AI initiatives?
    *   **Importance:** The availability of skilled personnel is paramount for successful AI project delivery. Identifying talent gaps early allows for strategic hiring, training, or partnership decisions.
*   **Question 4.2:** How open and adaptable is your organizational culture to embracing new AI technologies, experimenting, and learning from failures?
    *   **Importance:** An innovative and adaptable culture fosters experimentation and continuous improvement, which are essential for navigating the iterative nature of AI development and maximizing its potential.

### 5. Risk Management & Ethical AI
*   **Question 5.1:** Are there clear processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with AI (e.g., bias, security vulnerabilities, explainability)?
    *   **Importance:** Proactive risk management is crucial for building trustworthy and responsible AI systems. Addressing these concerns early in the discovery phase prevents costly issues down the line.
*   **Question 5.2:** Has your organization considered and established guidelines for the ethical implications of AI development and deployment?
    *   **Importance:** Ethical considerations are increasingly important for AI adoption. Establishing clear ethical guidelines ensures that AI solutions are developed and used responsibly, aligning with societal values and avoiding negative consequences.

## Scoring Methodology

Each question will be scored from 0 to 10. The total score for each of the 5 key areas will be the sum of the scores for the 2 questions within that area, resulting in a maximum score of 20 per area. The overall AI readiness score will be the sum of the scores from all 5 areas, with a maximum total score of 100.

To normalize the overall score to a 0-10 scale, the total score (out of 100) will be divided by 10.

**Formula:** Overall AI Readiness Score (0-10) = (Total Score from all questions / 10)
